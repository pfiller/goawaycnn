# Go Away, CNN

This is a barebones Chrome extension for blocking CNN.com in Chrome. It throws an overlay and makes you click a link before seeing the site. Hopefully the end result is that I go somewhere else.

**Todo:**

1. Style it like CNN (Because!)
2. Safari Extension
3. Firefox, too?
4. Read the New York Times
